            <em>Where to Plant Strawberries</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Basic considerations when locating a strawberry patch include:
            <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Full sun</li>
                <li>Well drained, sandy loam with a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 idealy</li>
                <li>Don't plant where tomatos, potatos, peppers or eggplants have been grown recently</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with rich, organic soil. Apply a balancer fertilizer (10-10-10) at plannting at the rate of one per 100 sq. ft. Fertilize again after renovation of June bearers or second harvest of day neutrals and everbeaning types. Do not over fertilizer or you will have excess leal growth and poor flowering. Do not fertilize strawberries late in the season in colder climate to prevent new growth that will be damaged by frost.
